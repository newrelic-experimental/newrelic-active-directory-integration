# New Relic Active Directory Integration

The New Relic Active Directory integration includes the configuration files required to successfully monitor the health and availability of your Active Directory environment.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* These configuration files require use of the New Relic Infrastructure Agent (NRIA) and interact with the [Flex](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/flex-integration-tool-build-your-own-integration/), [Logging](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/#winevtlog), and [Windows Services](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/windows-services-integration/) capabilities of NRIA.

### Process

For detailed instructions, please see the [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/active-directory-integration/).

At a high-level, installation of this integration includes the following steps.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Copy the contents of both `integrations.d` and `logging.d` into the associated directories on your target server.
3. Restart the `New Relic Infrastructure Agent` service.

#### PowerShell sample

**Copy files to target server**

```powershell
# integrations.d
Copy-Item -Path "<pathToRepo>\integrations.d\*" -Destination "C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d" -Recurse

# logging.d
Copy-Item -Path "<pathToRepo>\logging.d\*" -Destination "C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\logging.d" -Recurse
```

**Restart the agent**

```powershell
Restart-Service -Name "newrelic-infra" -Force
```

### Directory structure

```bash
C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\
    ├── integrations.d
    │   ├── windows-active-directory-performance-counters.ps1
    │   ├── windows-active-directory-performance-counters.yml
